Instructions to run WAVE3D and then plot the results

1. Run windows command prompt (cmd)

2. Change directory to the one WAVE3D.exe and model files are stored

3. Type run WAVE3D.exe on cmd

4. Once WAVE3D.exe runs, type: "call model files"	
	e.g. call IMAGE.m and hit enter

5. When the model run end type "q" for quit

6. To plot the results download and install 'DosBox' https://www.dosbox.com/

7. Run DosBox and on the command line type: 
	mount c "directory where "WVPLOT" and model output files are stored 
	e.g.:
	mount c C:\Documents\wave_plot
	c:
	
8. Then type WVPLOT and hit enter

9. To navigate through WVPLOT check instructions on the manual
